            <h1>The Silver Gene</h1>
    
            <p>The silver gene is a uniqe gene, while a bit difficult to understand, it is worth it to understand.</p>
            <h3>Reproducing the Silver Gene</h3>
            <p>The silver gene requires two qualifications to reproduce. One, a Labrador with two copies of the silver gene. Two, Labrador with at least one copy of the gene. Once this is met, they can breed and reproduce puppies with the silver gene. The yellow labrador can carry copies of the silver gene but since they are already a lighter color, it doesn't show.</p>
    
            <h3>What the silver gene really is</h3>
            <p>The silver gene is actually a mutation in the gene. This mutation results in a lighter, or almost discoloration. It does not really take away from the dog's health, and is handsome to behold. Therefore the silver gene is sought after and reproduced. The reason why the AKC does not recognize the silver as a color is because, is because it is actually a chocolate. Without the genetic altering it would be a chocolate. Charcoal, in a similer way, are actually blacks. Without the genetic difference, they would be the 'base' color, therefore not actually  being there 'own' color
            </p>
    
            <h3>Possibilties</h3>
            <p>The actually gene is symbolizes by Dd for one copy of silver and dd for two. DD is no copies of silver. To make it easier to understand, I will now refer to those as named. <br> When a dog with Dd and a dog with Dd breed, you will not get any silver colored dogs. With a dd and Dd, you will get equal Possibilties for silver, charcoal, and the base color(s) of the parents. A dog with dd and dd with breed all silvers and charcoals considering both parents have two copies of the silver gene<!--Diagram of genetics code-->.</p>
    
            <h3>Affects on health</h3>
            <p>The silver gene does not affect the dog's health, but there is health problems every dog will face. These problems can result from deseases to bad hips. Most of the probalems found in a dog are genetic, so when you breed dogs you want to check and see what or if the parent dog's health probalems are. The reason why it is assumed hthat silvers and charcoals have health probalems is because they are in minority. Even if the parents have health problems sometimes they get breed anyways. The question is, why not get a new dog to breed? Because a lot of times you can not breed your puppies because they are related. Breeders will charge much more if you try to buy a dog for breeding, which huge cost, sometime $1000 or more.</p>
