        <h1>Silver Genes</h1>
        <p>Labrador Retrievers can be registered on AKC in three different colors. Black, chocolate, and yellow, while there are only three recognized colors, there are about seven colors in reality. These colors are black, charcoal, chocolate, silver, yellow, fox red, and white. The charcoal is registered as <em>black</em>, the silver as <em>chocolate</em>, the white and fox red as <em>yellow</em>. Of the aforemention colors, today I want to focus on <a href = "silvergene/The Silver Gene.html">silver</a>.</p>
