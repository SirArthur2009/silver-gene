        <h1>Silver Genes</h1>
        <p>Labrador Retrievers can be registered on AKC in three different colors. Black, chocolate, and yellow, while there are only three rocognized colors, there are about six colors in reality. These colors are black, charcoal, chocolate, silver, yellow, and white. The charcoal is registered as <em>black</em>, the silver as <em>chocolate</em>, and the white as <em>yellow</em>. Of the aforemention colors, today I want to focus on <a href = "Silver gene/Silver gene.html">silver</a>.</p>
